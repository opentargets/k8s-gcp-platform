# This is a list of what to do as 'next steps'

1. For Clickhouse, I have created the PVs+PVCs that I will use as template for the deployment PVCs, but each deployment needs to have its own PVC definition that creates storage using the corresponding PV+PVC as data source. At this point I have two choices:
  a. Create a PVC for each deployment and lock Clickhouse and Opensearch scalability to 1 replica per zone.
  b. Create three Clickhouse stateful sets, each of them configured with affinity to their corresponding PVC template, allowing then for scalability.
  c. How can I trigger a re-build of the PVCs associated with either the deployments or the stateful sets?
2. Create a GitHub repository for POS to update image information every time it runs.
3. Create a Pull Request with the changes to the overlays back to the corresponding branch in the repository.
